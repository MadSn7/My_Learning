# JUnit5
- For Unit Testing
- Testing vs Unit Testing
    - Usually QA does testing.
    - Usually software developer(whoever writing the code) does Unit Testing.
    - In SDLC tsting is also there, this is done after building.
- You can yourself test code as well, call your methods functions for some input parameter and check the output with expected one, but it will be troublesome as the code grows over time.
- JUnit can help in that as well as keeps test uniformity.

## Architecture
- JUnit5 is not Junit4 + New feature, no backward compatibiliy.Much better , much newer.
- JUnit4 test have to use Vintage api to work.JUnit 5 uses Jupiter Apis.(All assertions etc are there)
- Extensions are also there, allows to use testing from other testing sources.
- IDEs are integrally inegrated with JUnit5 testing.
