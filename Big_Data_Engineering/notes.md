What is data?
Collection of info.

Data you can do two thing store and process.

Big Data
After internet and pc amount of data increased by many fold.
and storage and process became difficult, troublesome and costly.

Problems or charateristic of Big Data
1. Volume [There is always a bigger fish, some one says 25 GB, some says 100GB some petabytes]
2. Value(Quality)
3. Visulisation
4. Velocity
5. Variety(Strucured, Semi etc)
6. Volatility 7.Viability ....... etc etc

Under Big Data 10K+ technologies some of them Hadoop, Spark etc

Various stages of handling Big Data/ Data Layers

etc etc ..... Automation/Scheduling(Injetion) -> Storage -> Processing(Analysis) ->Testing -> Visualisation -> AI/ML(Analytics)  etc etc....

History of Hadoop
2002 Google released Paper on GFS(Google File System) to distribute the data, 2004 GMR(Google Map Reduce) process resuced data.
2005-06 : Hadoop Invented, Doug Cutting Ex-Yahoo and declared open source,Apache

      HDFS    MR(Map reduce) Basically from start to current hadoop has these 2 things only

Many companies built on top of hadoop add many features for helping, and sell services. Data bricks(sandbox), amazon(EMR),microsoft(Hdinsight),Ibm(Big Insight),Mapper(m3 etc)

Apache's Hadoop is base for it, work on it and help in all

Some things to know

Linux,SQL(Data query),Programming Language(Java(Also Scala), Python mainly but any works)

Data Engineering have many parts Big data is one, they are simialr but not same

The journey
Linux -> Sql -> Programming Languages -> Big Data Tools/Tech(Hadoop(HDFS,Hive),Spark(Spark batch Spark SQL) Mainly for begineer etc) -> ETL concepts and knowledge(Also Warehouse) -> Cloud computing -> Your Project Done,Use your knowledge


HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System) //Basis of any Big data Technology
